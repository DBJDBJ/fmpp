Fm++ :: Foundation Mechanisms for C++  
===================================================
### Version 1.5.1 

[Foundation Mechanism (FM) lies between a library and a framework.](http://dbjdbj.github.io/fmpp)
For example: it is a lot of code, but still std:io is an FM, rather than LIB. 
It might be said std standard lib is divided into Foundation Mechanisms.
Some might call them "components", but that is one heavily overloaded term.

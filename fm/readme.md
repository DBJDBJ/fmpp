#FM++  
##Quick Usage Overview  
-----------------

This is exclusively Windows C++ API product, built with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.  

- To use this lib add the path to this folder and include "fm.h" 
- There is no lib or dll. Everything is in headers. 
- Only UNICODE apps may be built with DBJ*FM++ 
- Fm++ is using _bstr_t, _varinat_t and wchar_t everywhere. 
- Almost all non-trivial mechanisms have testing (fancy term "units"), at the bottom of their headers. The code is not part of the compilation unless #defines to compile them in,
are defined, in application using the FM++.

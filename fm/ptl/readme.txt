This is surprisingly short and surprisingly functional implementation of
persistence added to standard C++ containers. Many thanks to Mr Al Stevens
of Dr. DOBBS Journal, upon whose idea this code has been developed.

This lib depends on DBJ*FM++. This lib is built with MSVC 7.1

NOTE: This is NOT an OO DBMS so please do not get carried away.

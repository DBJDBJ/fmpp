One surprisingly short and surprisingly functional implementation of
persistence using standard C++ containers. Many thanks to Mr Al Stevens
of Dr. DOBBS Journal, upon whose idea this code has been developed.

This lib depends on DBJ*FM++. This lib is built with MSVC latest version.

NOTE! This is NOT an OO DBMS so please do not get carried away.
